Using the inception model to classify images 
We have lots of family pictures (thousands of them) and it is hard to look for a pictures that have certain subject.
I used a pretrained inception model and used one of its layers activation to give me a vector for every picture.
This helped in classifying pictures. For example, paddling, canoeing, and kayaking pictures were classified under same category.
